# Stack Overflow Developer Survey Analysis

This project contains the analysis of select findings from the **Stack
Overflow Developer Survey**, performed using the **R programming
language**.\
The report focuses on career satisfaction, specialization trends, the
influence of education, and developer operating system preferences.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

The analysis concentrated on patterns of developer satisfaction, the
impact of professional experience, and the relationship between tooling
choices (Operating Systems) and career factors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Developer Satisfaction and Specialization

### **High Satisfaction**

Data Scientists and ML Specialists are consistently among the most
satisfied developer groups, reinforcing the strong career outlook for
these specializations.

### **Contrast in Leadership**

C-suite executive programmers show the highest contrast in satisfaction
levels, reporting both the largest proportions of **"extremely
satisfied"** and **"extremely dissatisfied"** respondents.

### **Experience Trends**

Average satisfaction levels over time vary across developer types but
generally remain robust for high-demand specializations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Education Factors

### **Intergenerational Correlation**

A clear correlation is observed between participant education levels and
the educational attainment of their parents, suggesting stable
intergenerational education patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Operating Systems (OS) Analysis

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aspect               Key Observation
  -------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  **General            Windows is the most commonly used OS across almost
  Preference**         all developer specializations.

  **Specialized        GNU/Linux is particularly popular among
  Usage**              Researchers and DS/ML Specialists, likely due to
                       performance needs and academic tooling.

  **Economic           MacOS usage is highest among C-suite developers,
  Correlation**        possibly reflecting salary-driven hardware
                       choices.

  **Salary             Unix-like OS users show noticeable differences in
  Distribution**       salary distributions (sorted by median).

  **Open-Source        Windows users proportionally contribute the least,
  Contribution**       while BSD and GNU/Linux users contribute the most.
